                    With the end of my internship coming up, I still don't know much about the IT world. Even though I
                    am a certified Docker
                    Associate and fairly familiar with Kubernetes, I wouldn't say that I am as comfortable with it
                    compared to my own
                    subject domain. Nevertheless, if it weren't for the supportive group I met here at Nebulaworks, I
                    would still be at
                    square one from the start of my internship. They all contributed to my understanding of Docker,
                    Kubernetes and general
                    Linux practives.

                    The engineering team, Richard, Matthew, Anthony, Aidan and Rob, are some of the people I wanted to
                    thank. Richard is a
                    humble, yet informative cloud engineer who is not afraid to take on any challenge. Despite being
                    extremely knowledgeable
                    on nearly any topic, his approachable personality seperates him from other people I met. Matthew
                    (<i>It seems that
                        everywhere I go, there is always someone that is also named Matthew!</i>) is another talented
                    engineer, sharing his
                    charisma to everyone. Like Richard, his reserved demeanor makes him enjoyable to converse, whether
                    it is Docker or rock
                    climbing.

                    Anthony is a rare exception to typical software gurus. Not only is he a domain expert in all of the
                    Nebulawork tools,
                    but his calming auroa radiates with modesty. His passion for work speaks for itself, from when he
                    interviewed me to
                    casual conversations about his recent training workshop. Rob is the closest one to home in that he
                    is a fellow Chapman
                    Alumni (<i>Represent!</i>) who is not afraid to speak his mind. His knowledge base puts him on the
                    same level as the
                    higher ups, which is indeed intimidating at first. However, his down to earth attitude offsets that
                    outer image.

                    Aidan (<i>Disclosure, I often say <b>Aiden</b>, which after learning recently about how other people
                        mistook his name,
                        makes me feel pretty bad haha)</i>, is the most recent add on to the Nebulaworks team. His drive
                    to learn has no
                    bounds, even if it means spending nights working on in-house projects that would benefit other
                    people's learning. His
                    unpretentious peronality attracts everyone, and his quirks makes the office ever the more lively.

                    The two other engineering interns that I'm with, Lynn and Josh, assisted me with their peer moral
                    support. Lynn's
                    outgoing desire for continuous learning pushes me to give it my all every day. Josh's calm yet
                    intuitive thinking
                    relaxes me when I am stressing over the smallest details in a test. Both him and Lynn had just as
                    much of a large factor
                    in my success here as the rest of the engineering team.

                    To conclude, everyone helped in my growth at the company. From offering advice on tricky topic to
                    walking through a
                    typical troubleshooting scenario, they molded me into who I am today: a more informed Computer
                    Science graduate. While
                    IT is not my original goal after graduation, this internship allowed me to expand my horizons in the
                    diverse career
                    bubble. These people taught me even if you have a wide array of knowledge, it will do you no good if
                    you lack character.
                    Humbleness combined with passion makes people successful in the long term. That alone proves that
                    the Nebulaworks team
                    is truly a blessing in today's world.
