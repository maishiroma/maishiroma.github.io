                    When I first completed my initial work on the website, I thought I was in a pretty good spot. All of
                    the new cleanup and fixes made myself pretty content with my site.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-area-text">
                    Then GDC 2021 happened. Without boring you all with the hard details, I'll just post a link to my
                    Linkedln
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maishiroma_gdc2021-unity-activity-6824535110092763136-qHLy"

                        post
                    </a>
                    on how I felt about attending GDC. In short though, I needed to do some <b>major</b> cleanup. And
                    thus, I got to work on another ambitious project; the Great Reformatting (I made it up on the spot,
                    but it sounds cool).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-area-text">
                    In total, these are all of the major changes I have done. In order on when I did them:
                </p>
                <ol class="blog-area-text">
                    <li>
                        Removed all projects that are not relevant to what I am currently doing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Edited portfolio module preview to be populated dynamically (sourcing a separate javascript file
                        to populate the contents).
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <img class=blog-area-sub-img src="../assets/images/blog/2021/reworking_again/demo.gif"
                        alt="Demo of modal">
                    <p class="blog-area-sub-img-subtitle">
                        Demonstration of new modal layout, note how it can be scrolled with more images!
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Renamed and reorganized all of the site assets (images, JS) to be more clear and concise.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <img class=blog-area-sub-img src="../assets/images/blog/2021/reworking_again/new_hierarchy.png"
                        alt="hierarchy image">
                    <p class="blog-area-sub-img-subtitle">
                        Small preview of the new hierarchy.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Fixed up some missing images, cleaned up links to be more relevant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Resolved 404 page to be resolvable anywhere (woohoo!).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added new portfolio items, all of which are recent game jams I partook in!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A new blog post describing this!
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="blog-area-text">
                    These changes, while fairly minute, are significant in that they allow myself to properly showcase
                    the work that I really wanted to showcase on my site. For instance, I wanted to talk about the
                    design aspect of each game, since I find those aspects not only insightful for others, but also
                    allows one to peer into my own thinking behind each game. Plus, it also gave me another opportunity
                    to showcase my new modal preview design!
                </p>
                <p class="blog-area-text">
                    While I cannot say that work will ever truly be done on this site, I found that this step marked a
                    new age of work and contribution to the site. Not only was I able to more easily add content to the
                    portfolio, it allowed me to hone my own programming skills; from creating functional methods to
                    easily parse data to accurately convert html strings to what I wanted. While in the end, all of this
                    could be done in a more advanced framework (i.e. Jekyll), I enjoy seeing how much I can work on my
                    website using the very basic framework and tools given.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-area-text">
                    Now, does that mean this site will never use anything more complex? Of course not! Like how my
                    current gig is about embracing new technologies and tooling, I am only using the tools that I find
                    the most success in my own workflows. Sure, one can jump to the next shiny key in their keyring, but
                    that doesn't always justify the need to keep on changing for the sake of changing. Until there is a
                    drastic need to revamp my website, I will continue on the path of static site hosting via GitHub
                    Pages using a simplistic framework.

                    So, now you might be asking,
                    <i>
                        Matthew, what else are you going to do now that you're content with
                        the site again?
                    </i>
                    Well, the answer is quite obvious! I currently have a game project that I have stopped temporarily,
                    since I wanted to get a head start on my website edits after viewing GDC. This project, while still
                    a Proof of Concept, is currently at the point where I can jump back into with a goal in mind. That
                    goal being <b>networking and online multiplayer</b>. After that, I can't say what else I have in
                    store for myself, but I will say this: I think it is about time where I start to really pour a lot
                    of soul and love into a <i>real</i> passion game project. Anyway, if you are curious, the GitHub
                    repo for my multiplayer project can be found <a href="https://github.com/maishiroma/Project_Brng"
                        target="_blank">
                        here
                    </a>.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-area-text">
                    On the topic of personal projects, what else has been up with me, besides game making?
                    I was experimenting around with a personal VPN travel router, since I wanted to delve a bit into the
                    world of home networking. I recently invested in a Chromcast, so I wanted to mess around with how I
                    can cast media onto my monitor as well as have another solution for traveling securely. Besides
                    that, I am also
                    a proud owner of a new Twitter account! You might have seen it on the footer of the site already.
                    Regardless, I
                    wanted another media outlet to showcase my work and career growth outside of Linkedln, and Twitter
                    seems to be the
                    best platform for that. So come and follow me <i>@maishiroma</i>, if you want to hear me ramble on
                    about my engineering development endeavour as well as video game rants!
                </p>
                <p class="blog-area-text">
                    And that's it for this update! Of course, if you want to see those new game jam projects I was apart
                    of, come check it out at
                    my <a href="../index.html">home page</a>. I'll be posting more updates to it over time. Until then,
                    stay safe
                    and thanks for reading my latest post! Until next time!
