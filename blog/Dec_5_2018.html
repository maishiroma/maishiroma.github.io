                    Remember me? It has been over 4 months since I last updated this blog site. During that timeframe, I
                    encountered new
                    challenges, rediscovered my self, and became a more intresting individual. To start, I am now
                    confortably sitting with a
                    relatively shiny new certification from the Cloud Computing Foundation on being a Kubernetes
                    Administrator! Ever since I
                    got the Docker certification, I was already pushing myself to learn Kubernetes within a month so
                    that I can take the
                    exam before my internship time was up. It was arduous, studying from various online classes to
                    manually spinning up a
                    Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Engine. In the end, I was able to pass the test confortable and
                    concluded my
                    internship program on a high note.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-area-text">
                    From there, I was immediatly taken out for a treat courtesy of the CEO of Nebulaworks (It was
                    absolutely delicious!)
                    along with other engineers and fellow intern, Lynn Dong, on passing the Kubernetes Exam. However,
                    this was only just the
                    start of the next few months where I am working on a contract project for the company! While I
                    cannot disclose any
                    information regarding it, all I can say is that it was the first push in the right direction on what
                    I needed to improve
                    on as a Computer Science major. Not only did I still learn continuously on the job (learning the
                    HashiCorp suite to
                    refining my GitHub skills), but I saw what Nebulaworks truly shines at. Being apart of that
                    experience was something I
                    know I would never be able to replicate anytime soon.

                    Anyway, the TL;DR of my last paragraph can be summed up as I am leaving my position at Nebulaworks
                    to pursue an offer
                    that I received in the game industry. It pains me to leave such a warm, caring, and outright chill
                    group of people and
                    supervisors, but I know that I would only be hurting myself if I face away from the truth. Being a
                    DevOps Specialist was
                    definetly a worthwhile experience and I do not regret any day that I was at the company, but it is
                    time for me to
                    continue my life journey to its next chapter. I don't want to make this blog post too sappy already
                    (saving that for
                    Linkedln at the time of this), but I just want to thank everyone that I know for helping me get to
                    this point. It has
                    been a part of my life now and it will hold a special place in my heart moving forward. Nebulaworks
                    is going to go
                    places, and I can already see the shining enthusiasum in all of its employees. You guys made me
                    realize there's more to
                    IT and changed my perspective on Linux in more ways than one. That, along with all of the memories
                    of being around you
                    guys will be this year's highlights for sure. Thanks for making my first out of college job special
                    and unforgettable.
                    You guys are truly the best.
