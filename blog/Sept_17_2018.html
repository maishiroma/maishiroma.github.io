                    Coming straight out of college, the first thing most graduates would do is taking more classes
                    during
                    the summer.
                    However, taking a break was the last thing on my mind when I concluded my undergraduate education at
                    Chapman
                    University. To me, learning never stops, especially in the dynamic field that is Computer Science. I
                    made it a
                    personal goal to apply myself to every job I partake in. Thus, when I was offered to have a summer
                    IT
                    internship, I
                    knew I already mentally prepared for what's to come. At least that's what I <i>thought</i>.

                    During my internship, I was tasked to learn two softwares that I never heard of during my undergrad:
                    Docker and
                    Kubernetes. Not only that, I was also challenged into become a Certified Docker Associate <b>AND</b>
                    Certified
                    Kubernetes Associate within the span of my internship (~three months). <i>Welp</i>. While this may
                    seem
                    fairly
                    strange for someone who is exposed to technology all the time, I accepted this major task and
                    started to
                    experiment
                    with them.

                    First, in order to understand Kubernetes I needed to understand Docker. In order to understand
                    Docker, I
                    needed to
                    familiarize myself with Shell Commands, Terminal Text Editors, and Linux Commands. Out of those
                    three, I
                    had the
                    most familiarity with Shell Text Editors, and it was <i>not</i> as pleasant as how many Linux users
                    see
                    it. From
                    this alone, I had a lot of catching up to do.

                <p class="blog-area-text">
                    For the next two months, I dived deep into the heart of Linux Systems and Docker, learning more
                    about
                    the OS and the
                    software than ever before. From the relatively easy vimtutor tutorial, the sometimes incoherent
                    lecture
                    videos on
                    Linux, DevOps, and Docker, to participating in formal remote classes proctored by certified Docker
                    trainers, I
                    slowly made progress in becoming a Docker Associate and DevOps in general. I also went through an
                    abundant of GitHub
                    repositories, practicing on typical Docker scenarios like as image creation and backing up DTR. I
                    even
                    had the drive
                    to install some plugins that were on my work laptop onto my personal computer so I could practice
                    using
                    its the
                    tools in my free time (<i>Did I say free time? HAHA I wish</i>).

                    Fast forward to the latter end of August 2018. I still couldn't fathom that I managed to become
                    somewhat
                    proficient
                    at shell scripting, Linux systems, and Docker concepts. The past 1.5 months felt like I was taking a
                    summer course
                    except the only professors I had was myself and Google. I was still shaky on some aspects, but I
                    knew
                    it's now or
                    never to take the Docker Certification exam. Despite exam was meant to be taken by people who had
                    3-6
                    months of
                    Docker experience, I went in with barely half of the minimum time. It was an uphill battle all the
                    way,
                    and the exam
                    itself was no exception.

                    Thankfully (and a bit bluntly) Docker immediately notified me of my results as soon as I submitted
                    the
                    exam. While I
                    will never know my actual score from the rather confusing metrics they spat at me (unless my
                    impromptu
                    math was
                    correct) I passed! I couldn't believe it myself, working nonstop on three topics that lead up to
                    Docker,
                    and in only
                    1.5 months, I was able to get an official certification. Nevertheless, this isn't the end of the
                    road in
                    my
                    internship. I will still be learning more and more during it, despite my accomplishment. Just as I
                    graduated from
                    college, the educated mindset never rests. Now, onto the Kubernetes certification!
