# Matthew Shiroma's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website that I use for personal branding and to showcase my projects.

As of 2025, I have changed the framework of the website to use `hugo` as my go to deployment method, using the [hugo-profile](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile) theme.

## How To Develop

To work on this site, you will need the following:
- `go` (>= 1.24.1)
- `hugo` (>= v0.145.0-666444f0a52132f9fec9f71cf25b441cc6a4f355+extended)
- Familiarity with the command line

1. Make sure all of the dependencies are downloaded and required
1. Run `hugo server -D`
1. Navigate to localhost:1313

From there, it is a matter of knowing the hugo syntax and what hugo-profile offers. See their docs for details
