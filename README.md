# Matthew Shiroma's Portfolio

- Welcome! This is the source code for my portfolio site! Here, you will find all of the things that I made across my years as a CS major.
- This website uses the [Dark Joe](https://themewagon.com/themes/dark-joe-responsive-one-page-personal-website-template/) template.

## How To Develop
Since this website is fairly simplistic with its usage, there isn't too many requirements to get going with development. All one needs is a text editor and a modern browser.

To see a page rendered, one can simply enter:

```bash
$ open pageName.index
```

in `Terminal` and the page should open in your configured browser.
