## Project Duration

*Feb 2018 - May 2018*

## Overview

Tasked to help create a Kickstarter app that works in cotangent with the comic book included in one of the Kickstarter bonuses.

A mobile Augmented Reality game designed in Unity 2017 and with Vuforia where the player can be immersed into the world of the comic book by looking at specific pages. On each interaction, the player hears a voice over audio clip, followed by a model associated with the page. With each interaction, the player collects special tokens that unlock an exclusive AR experience at the end of the comic book.

The player can interact with some of these models, by tapping on them.

Tasks in this internship included:
- Implementing the UI and navigation for the app.
- Integrated models that the art team created into the project.
- Mapped out the bump, height, normal, and texture maps to each model.
    - Added the appropriate shaders to each model according to how they look.
    - Experimented with third party translucent and glow shaders.
    - Associated the proper animations each model came with, creating scripts to play each animation appropriately.
    - Also troubleshooted animation integration from Maya when appropriate
- Created a basic NPC AI for one interaction.
    - Moves around a given area.
    - Jumps and flashes its light when touched
    - Fades out/fades in when it reaches a certain area

Created the AR video interaction.
- Used a video that was on a server
- Video shrinks once it finished playing

Learned and distributed iOS builds to the in house team using iTunes Connect and TestFlight.
- Published iOS and Android builds on the App Store and Google Play Store.
- Self designed tasks alongside with other interns.
- Researched other third party plugins that can be used in future builds of the game.
- Attempted to analyze and distribute a working prototype of the game that was using the Kudan plugin.

Worked remotely, but had weekly intern meetings where all of the company interns met with their supervisors.
- We discussed accomplished tasks, clarified on issues that arose.
- For communication, we used Asana and Discord to bridge the interns and supervisors together.
