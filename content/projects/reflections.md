## Project Duration

*Sept 2016 - Dec 2016*

## Overview

Lead Programmer for the semester long group project in my Level Design II class. I created player movement, dialogue, and scripted events.
- A first person, narrative driven game in Unity 5 that visually explores the stages of depression

Some of the specific mechanics I creates are:
- Dialogue system
- Sound volume proximity
- Collect collectibles to trigger an event
