## Project Duration

*July 2018 - October 2018*

## Overview

> NOTE: Due to the NDA Agreement upon signing, I cannot share any pictures of the final product.

The company that I was a Research and Development Intern brought me onboard for a temporary in-house project. The project will be used as a proof-of-concept for the company to pitch later. The prototype was a mobile Augmented Reality 3D multiplayer fighting game. The game was created in Unity 2018, using various plugins such as AR Kit, AR Core, and Photon.

Some of the tasks that I did include:
- Programmed the user interface for the main menus, lobby, and main gameplay
- Created custom scripts that allowed for specific functionality in certain menus
- Implemented the real world scanning feature for the game

During the duration of this project, I worked closely with professional artists, placing their assets into the game, making sure the model, animations, and textures are properly imported.
