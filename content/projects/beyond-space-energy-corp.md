## Project Duration

*Feb 2017 - Jun 2017*

## Overview

I was the assistant Programmer for a senior thesis at Chapman University. This is a first person, tower defense mobile VR game that tasks the player to fend off aliens while collecting resources.Created in Unity 5, it was showcased at the 2017 Chapman Digital Arts Thesis Screening and at the 2017 IEEE GameSig.

Some of my tasks included:
- Autosaving: After each mission, the playerâ€™s progress, unlocked traps, and upgrades are saved.
- Trap functionality, such as the bear trap (when an alien walks into it, the trap activated, stunning and damaging the alien.)
- Source Control Manager, using GitHub and implementing a system of making sure all work is pushed and merged effectively.
