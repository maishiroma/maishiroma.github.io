Hello everyone...again! It feels a bit surreal to be writing this, but long time no see! And you might be wondering yourself, what is going on with Matthew Shiroma? Well, this post should clear things up for you all!

If you remembered my last blog post (which was over 3 years ago!) I was planning to leave my internship at Nebulaworks in pursue of a new job. Well, things changed and now I am a full time Cloud Engineer at Nebulaworks! It is a long story how I found myself back here, but I am excited to be continuing my saga at Nebulaworks again! And this time, the road is not as treacherous as the first time!

Specifically, I grown into my current position, building up all of the skills that I originally layed out. From Terraform, Vault, Ansible, CI/CD, Python, Go, the list goes on and on. In short, in the span of those 3 years, I feel like I've grown a lot being a Cloud Engineer, delving more and more into the role of a System Administrator. It's strange, but at the same time, equally rewarding. That feeling stems from the excellent leadership and co-workers I am blessed to be apart of.

Having people to lean on during technical challenges really helps any young engineer grow as a person and professionally. I felt like these three years (which now I am typing this, is almost my entire undergraduate!!!) have been extremely fruitful. I cannot begin to imagine how I would have grown if I didn't find myself at Nebulaworks again. As such, I am grateful to be apart of that team again.

So what about personal life? Well, as of this writing, THAT happened so I've just been working on some side projects, mostly things like [game jams](https://github.com/maishiroma/LudumDare_47) and [a multiplayer minecraft bootstrapper](https://github.com/maishiroma/MCServerBootstrap). These have helped me really exercise the new skills I picked up either during my job or casually as I continue making games as a side hobby. Will I return to the hunt on game making? That will be something you will have to find out later!

Nevertheless, if the title of this post isn't obvious, I also recently spent some time cleaning up my portfolio site. I really wanted to find some time to clean up some of the little nuances I found after I started working full time. Hence, you see this new section along some other little fixes! What are those, you might be asking? Well, that is for you to find out!

Regardless, I will be updating my site more often as I get ideas on new formats or new blog posts such as this one! I hope you all enjoyed reading this and as I say it again, it feels good to be back!
