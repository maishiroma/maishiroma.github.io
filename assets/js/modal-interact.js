               "<li>Developing an original player controller, inspired by Tomb Radar 2013, where player movement is relative to camera position.</li>" +
               "<li>Developed a camera controller to compliment the player controller.</li>" +
               "<ul>" +
               "<li>Camera is free control, meaning it will always be looking at the player</li>" +
               "<li>Camera automatically adjusts distance to prevent it from clipping into obstacles</li>" +
               "<li>If camera is too close to player, player will become transparent</li>" +
               "<li>Can zoom in, out and reset itself to be behind the player at any time.</li>" +
               "</ul>" +
               "<li>Designed a parkour system, inspired by Mirrorâ€™s Edge.</li>" +
               "<ul>" +
               "<li>Can climb up ledges and shimmy across them</li>" +
               "<li>If thereâ€™s a ledge above or below the player, the player will climb up/down them accordingly</li>" +
               "</ul>" +
               "<li>Designed an ivy climbing system.</li>" +
               "<ul>" +
               "<li>If the player is close to a specific terrain, the player can move up, down and side to side on it, or jump off of it</li>" +
               "</ul>" +
               "<li>Integrated animations with the player, enviroments, and enemies.</li>" +
               "<li>Created a three terminal system that links UI interaction to the gameplay.</li>" +
               "<ul>" +
               "<li>Network: Player can select a gadget that is associated with that terminal and toggle it on/off. This dynamically interacts with objects in the environment, allowing the player to proceed.</li>" +
               "<li>Main Frame: Player can see all of the gadgets and tools that are associated with any given terminal.</li>" +
               "<li>System Files: Player can read the lore of the game, using a system of list buttons.</li>" +
               "</ul>" +
               "<li>Created the Shield Projector, a tool that the player can pick up and use during gameplay. This creates a permeant shield that allows the player to use it as a platform or to block an enemyâ€™s attack</li>" +
               "<li>Designed the Enemy AI</li>" +
               "<ul>" +
               "<li>Patrol Bots: Wanders around a given area, until it sees the player. If it sees the player, the bot will give chase, shooting at the player and alerting other bots that it is associated with in the area. If the player is far away from the patrol bot after alerting it, it will go back into patrol mode.</li>" +
               "<li>Turrets: Hidden until the player is within its range, then appears and fires at the player until the player is out of its range.</li>" +
